#CareSwears <3

It's 3am Saturday morning.
You're finishing up the last bit of code on your application when disaster strikes

You accidentally type in "sudo rm -rf /*"

In your rage, you scream "F**K!"

##### "Cha-Ching", "You just added $0.25 to 'Swear Jar'"


Swearing is one of the worst things you can do to ruin a positive development environment, which is why we're here to help. 

Using the Chrome WebKit Voice Recognition API, CareSwears listens for swears while the application is open. Each time our application recognizes a swear word, it uses the BlockChains API to send a Bitcoin transaction to a specified "Swear Jar" address. This address can be of a charity, a friend's wallet, the possibilities are endless.
